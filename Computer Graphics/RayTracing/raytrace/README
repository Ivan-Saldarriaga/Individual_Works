CAP4730 RayTracing Assignment

Overview:
Demonstrates the principles of ray tracing. Here you can see a scene I created, change the camerae mode and watch a short animation.

Usage:

1. Open the application
2. cd into the bin folder
3. run the 'make' command
   This should get the .cpp running easily, beacuse everything is contained in the folder itself.

Functionality:

1. Press 'SPACEBAR' to change the camera mode from orthographic to perspective.
2. Press the '1' key to have the animation start playing (can do from either camera modes!)
3. Press 's' to STOP the animation at anytime
4. Press 'ESCAPE' to quit the program!

MISC.
You can watch the short animations in the output folders.
Output contains the orthographic recording
Output2 contains the perspective recording
