CAP4730 RayTracing Assignment

Overview:
Demonstrates the basics of OPENGL and model transformations.

Usage:

1. Open the application
2. cd into the bin folder
3. run the 'make' command
   This should get the .cpp running easily, beacuse everything is contained in the folder itself.
   Note: This program is designed for GPU implementation (though the CPU implementation is comment out).
   - If instead, you want to run the CPU version navigate to the CPU_Version folder, copy the code and paste it in the src folder .cpp and run the makefile after saving

Functionality:

1. Press/Hold 'Up/Down/Left/Right' arrow keys to translate the object in different directions
2. Press/Hold the 'R' key to rotate the model (it rotates along all axes at once)
3. Press/Hold 'S' key to skrink the model (scalilng down)
4. Press/Hold the 'G' key to grow the model (scaling up)
5. Press 'ESCAPE' to quit the program!
